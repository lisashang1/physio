The following code uses data from the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012 to develop a model for predicting hospital length of stay (LOS). 
The data from PhysioNet include 8,000 unique hospital stays with time series labs/vitals information, information collected during admission, and our key outcome of 
length of stay.
